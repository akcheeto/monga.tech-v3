monga.tech-v3

Hey there. Welcome to the repository for the third iteration of my personal portfolio and website, monga.tech.

What's This?

This repo contains the code powering my personal site, where I showcase my projects, particularly those related to biomedical engineering, CAD modeling, prosthetics, and other cool tech explorations. It's designed to be both visually appealing and functionally streamlined.

Why v3?

I constantly evolve my site to reflect my latest work and interests. Version 3 brings a refreshed look, improved interactivity, and a smoother overall experience. Itâ€™s built to better highlight my current projects and skills.

Tech Stack
HTML, CSS, JS, anime.js and three.js
WebGL for interactive 3D model rendering

Features

Interactive 3D CAD models directly in-browser
Responsive design for easy navigation
Simple, clean, and modern aesthetics

Running Locally?
Want to run or play around with this locally? It's simple:

git clone https://github.com/akcheeto/monga.tech-v3.git
cd monga.tech-v3
open index.html with live server

Or use your preferred local web server setup to test out changes

I'm always open to feedback and improvements. If you see anything that could be done better or just want to chat about tech, feel free to open an issue or connect with me directly!

Thanks for dropping by,
AK
